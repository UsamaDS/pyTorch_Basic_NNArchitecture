# PyTorch Learning Journey  

This repository documents my learning process with **PyTorch**, covering fundamental concepts and practical implementations. It contains Jupyter notebooks that reflect each step of my progress, from the basics to building neural network models for different types of data.  

## ðŸ“š Learning Steps  

1. **Introduction to PyTorch**  
   - Learned tensors, operations, and basic autograd functionality.  
   - Explored how to build and train simple models using `torch.nn` and `torch.optim`.  

2. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**  
   - Implemented a basic feedforward classification model.  
   - Trained on structured/tabular data.  
   - Learned about loss functions, activation functions, and optimization.  

3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**  
   - Shifted to CNNs to improve performance on image data.  
   - Experimented with convolution, pooling, and deeper architectures.  
   - Compared results with the initial ANN model.  

4. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) & LSTM**  
   - Applied sequence models to handle text data.  
   - Learned about hidden states and vanishing gradient problems.  
   - Implemented RNN and LSTM models for text classification and sequence prediction tasks.
